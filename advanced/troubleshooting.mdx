description: Common issues and solutions when using Stobo MCP server
---

This guide covers common issues you may encounter when using Stobo MCP and how to resolve them.

## Common issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No API key configured">
    Free tools work without a key. If you're calling a paid tool (`generate_llms_txt`, `extract_tone`, `rewrite_article`, or `get_credits`):

    1. Sign up at [trystobo.com](https://trystobo.com)
    2. Go to **Settings > API Keys**
    3. Add `STOBO_API_KEY` to your editor config
    4. Restart your editor

    <Note>
      Tools like `audit_site`, `audit_article`, `generate_robots_txt`, `generate_sitemap`, `generate_freshness_code`, and `audit_freshness` all work without an API key.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Your API key is invalid or expired">
    If you receive an authentication error:

    1. Log in at [trystobo.com](https://trystobo.com)
    2. Navigate to **Settings > API Keys**
    3. Generate a new API key
    4. Update `STOBO_API_KEY` in your MCP server config
    5. Restart your editor

    The error response includes a status code of `401` or `403`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You've run out of credits">
    When you see this error (status code `402`):

    - Top up your credits at [trystobo.com](https://trystobo.com)
    - Free tools continue to work without credits
    - Check your remaining balance using the `get_credits` tool

    <Warning>
      Only `generate_llms_txt` (500 credits), `extract_tone` (500 credits), and `rewrite_article` (1,000 credits) consume credits. All other tools are free.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate limit reached">
    If you hit rate limits:

    - Wait a moment and try again
    - Rate limits reset quickly
    - Normal conversational use stays well within limits

    The server returns a `429` status code for rate limit errors.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Connection issues">
    To diagnose connection problems:

    1. Ask your AI assistant to run the `check_connection` tool
    2. Check your internet connection
    3. Verify `STOBO_BASE_URL` is not set (it defaults to the correct value)
    4. Try again in a few minutes if the API is temporarily down

    The `check_connection` tool returns diagnostic information including:
    - Current base URL being used
    - Whether an API key is configured
    - HTTP status code or connection error details
    - Suggested fixes for common issues
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tool not showing up in your editor">
    If Stobo tools aren't appearing:

    1. Save your config file and **restart** the editor completely
    2. Verify `uvx` is installed by running `uvx --version` in your terminal
    3. Test the server manually: `uvx --native-tls stobo-mcp` — it should start without errors
    4. Check that your config file syntax is valid JSON
    5. Ensure the config file is in the correct location for your editor

    <Note>
      For Claude Desktop, the config is at `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows.
    </Note>
