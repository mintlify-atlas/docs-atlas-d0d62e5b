description: Create an llms.txt file to help AI assistants understand your website
---

Create an llms.txt file so AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity) can understand your website structure and content.

## Overview

`generate_llms_txt` creates a spec-compliant llms.txt file:

- **Automatic content discovery** — crawls your site to understand structure
- **Spec-compliant format** — follows the llms.txt standard
- **Ready to deploy** — returns content you can paste into /llms.txt
- **AI optimized** — helps AI assistants cite your content correctly

<Warning>
This tool requires an API key and costs 500 credits per generation.
</Warning>

## Parameters

<ParamField path="url" type="string" required>
  Your website URL (domain or full URL). The tool will crawl from here to discover your site structure.
</ParamField>

## Example prompts

```
Generate an llms.txt for https://example.com
```

```
My llms.txt check failed — fix it
```

```
Create an llms.txt file for my site
```

## Response structure

The tool returns a JSON object with:

<ResponseField name="content" type="string">
  The complete llms.txt file content, ready to deploy at /llms.txt on your domain root
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pages_analyzed" type="number">
  Number of pages crawled to build the file
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="sections" type="array">
  List of sections included in the llms.txt
</ResponseField>

## Usage example

```python
# How the tool is called in the MCP server
@mcp.tool(annotations=WRITE)
def generate_llms_txt(url: str) -> str:
    """Create an llms.txt file to help AI assistants understand your website."""
    client = _get_client()
    return _call(client.generate_llms_txt, url)
```

## What is llms.txt?

llms.txt is a standardized file format that helps AI assistants understand your website:

- **Site summary** — brief description of what your site offers
- **Key pages** — important pages AI should know about
- **Content structure** — how your content is organized
- **Update frequency** — when content is typically refreshed

Example llms.txt structure:

```
# Example Company

Example Company provides AI-powered tools for developers.

## Key pages

- Homepage: https://example.com
- Documentation: https://example.com/docs
- Blog: https://example.com/blog
- API Reference: https://example.com/api

## Content sections

### Documentation
Comprehensive guides and tutorials for all features.
Location: /docs

### Blog
Product updates, tutorials, and industry insights.
Location: /blog
Update frequency: Weekly
```

## When to use

Use `generate_llms_txt` when:

- **audit_site shows llms.txt is missing** — most common trigger
- **Launching a new site** — include from day one for better AI visibility
- **Major site restructure** — regenerate after significant changes
- **Content strategy changes** — update when adding new sections

<Tip>
Run [audit_site](/tools/audit-site) first to confirm llms.txt is missing or needs updating.
</Tip>

## Deployment

After generating the file:

1. Copy the `content` from the response
2. Save it as `llms.txt` at your domain root
3. Deploy to `https://yourdomain.com/llms.txt`
4. Verify it's accessible publicly

<Note>
The file must be at your domain root (/llms.txt), not in a subdirectory.
</Note>

## Cost

Generating an llms.txt costs **500 credits**. This includes:

- Crawling up to 50 pages of your site
- Content analysis and summarization
- Spec-compliant file generation

## Next steps

- [audit_site](/tools/audit-site) — verify llms.txt is working after deployment
- [generate_sitemap](/tools/generate-sitemap) — help AI assistants discover all your content
