## Plans

Stobo offers several subscription tiers:

- **Pro** — 50,000 credits/month
- **Enterprise** — Custom credit allocation

See [pricing guide](/guides/pricing) for details.

## When to use

Use `get_credits` to:

- **Check before expensive operations** — verify you have enough credits before running rewrite_article
- **Monitor usage** — track which tools consume most credits
- **Budget planning** — understand your usage patterns
- **Troubleshooting** — verify account status if operations fail

<Tip>
Run this before starting a large batch of operations to ensure you have sufficient credits.
</Tip>

## Credit management

### Monthly reset

Credits reset on your billing date each month:

- Unused credits expire (don't roll over)
- New allocation becomes available immediately
- Usage counters reset to zero

### Running out of credits

If you exhaust your monthly credits:

- Free tools continue working
- Paid tools return 402 Payment Required error
- Purchase additional credits at [trystobo.com](https://trystobo.com)
- Or wait for monthly reset

<Warning>
Paid tools (generate_llms_txt, extract_tone, rewrite_article) will fail if you have insufficient credits. Check your balance first.
</Warning>
