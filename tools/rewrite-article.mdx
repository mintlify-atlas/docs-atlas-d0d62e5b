@mcp.tool(annotations=WRITE)
def rewrite_article(
    url: str,
    customer_id: str | None = None,
) -> str:
    """Rewrite an existing article to improve its SEO and AI visibility."""
    client = _get_client()
    return _call(client.optimize, url, customer_id=customer_id, sync=True)
```

## What gets optimized

The rewrite improves:

### SEO optimizations

- **Title tag** — includes target keyword, under 60 characters
- **Meta description** — compelling summary, under 160 characters
- **Heading structure** — proper H1/H2/H3 hierarchy
- **Content depth** — adds detail where needed (target 1500+ words)
- **Readability** — improves Flesch-Kincaid score
- **Internal links** — adds relevant internal links
- **Image optimization** — suggests better alt text

### AEO optimizations

- **FAQ section** — adds common questions and answers
- **List formatting** — converts prose to scannable lists
- **Table of contents** — adds navigation for long articles
- **Direct answers** — adds concise answer boxes
- **Examples** — includes real-world use cases
- **Code blocks** — properly formatted code (if technical content)
- **Key takeaways** — summary section for quick scanning

### Brand voice preservation

- Maintains your tone (formal, casual, technical, friendly)
- Uses your vocabulary level and word choices
- Follows your sentence structure patterns
- Applies your formatting preferences
- Keeps your stylistic choices (humor, metaphors, etc.)

## Prerequisites

Before using `rewrite_article`, you should:

1. **Extract your tone profile** using [extract_tone](/tools/extract-tone)
2. **Audit the article** using [audit_article](/tools/audit-article) (optional, but helpful to see before/after)

<Note>
If you haven't run `extract_tone`, the rewrite will use a generic professional tone. Always extract your tone first for best results.
</Note>

## When to use

Use `rewrite_article` for:

- **Low-performing content** — articles with poor SEO/AEO scores
- **Outdated articles** — refresh old content for current best practices
- **Thin content** — expand shallow articles with more depth
- **Unstructured content** — improve scanability and structure
- **Competitor analysis** — match or exceed competitor article quality

<Tip>
Focus on your top 10-20 most important articles first. Optimizing key articles has more impact than rewriting everything.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extract brand voice">
    Run [extract_tone](/tools/extract-tone) on your blog (500 credits, one-time)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Audit the article">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Rewrite the article">
    Run `rewrite_article` to get optimized version (1,000 credits)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the changes">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish the update">
    Copy the `rewritten.content` and publish to your site
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify improvement">
    Run [audit_article](/tools/audit-article) again to confirm better scores
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Cost

Rewriting an article costs **1,000 credits**. This includes:

- Full article audit (SEO + AEO)
- AI-powered content rewriting
- Brand voice application
- SEO and AEO optimizations
- Before/after comparison

<Note>
This is more expensive than other tools because it involves AI content generation, not just analysis.
</Note>

You own all rewritten content:

- No attribution required
- Use commercially without restrictions
- Edit further as needed
- Publish anywhere

## Next steps
